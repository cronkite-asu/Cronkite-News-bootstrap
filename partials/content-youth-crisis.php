        <p>Cronkite News will spend the next year covering youth suicide. Suicide has become the second-leading cause of death among young people ages 15 to 24 in America, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db352.htm" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. And in Arizona, the statistics are even more grim: America’s Health Rankings from United Health Foundation found that Arizona’s suicide rate among 15 to 24 year olds is higher than the national average. Cronkite News will examine the rise of suicides, analyze the underlying societal, cultural, technological and medical causes behind the trend, explore how people are combating the problem and highlight initiatives that work elsewhere. This special project and in-depth coverage is made possible, in part, through a grant from the Arizona Community Foundation.</p>
